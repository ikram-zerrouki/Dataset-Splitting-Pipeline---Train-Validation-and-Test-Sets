# Dataset Splitting Pipeline - Train, Validation, and Test Sets

## Description
This Python project provides a script for splitting image datasets into training, validation, and test sets. The splitting is customizable, allowing you to define the percentage of images allocated to each set. This tool is crucial for preparing datasets for machine learning model development and ensures that the dataset is organized efficiently for training and evaluation.
- **Training Set**: 70% of the dataset
- **Validation Set**: 10% of the dataset
- **Test Set**: 20% of the dataset
These ratios are default values and can be adjusted according to your specific requirements.
  
## Features
- **Customizable Splitting**: Easily adjust the proportion of images in each dataset split.
- **Versatility**: Can be used with any image dataset.
- **Automatic Directory Creation**: Automatically creates directories for storing the split datasets if they don't exist.

## Usage
1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine.
2. **Place your dataset** in the `Dataset/images` directory.
3. **Run the script** to split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
4. **Access the processed datasets** in the `Processed_Dataset` directory.
